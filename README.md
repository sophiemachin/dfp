# Dating for powerlifters

My strong friend J had the unhinged idea to create a dating app where all you see is the lifters total and bodyweight. No age, no photos, none of that fluff. Just pure lifting stats. 

Since telling some rowers about this abomination they got very excited. So fret no, a rowing version containing only your bodyweight and 2k time will follow the powerlifting version.
